To calculate the moves one path takes:
ants + the rooms between source and sink OR
ants + the number of edges minus 1

	Example1:

			ANTS: 7
				source
				|
				room1
				|
				room2
				|
				room3
				|
				sink

				There are 3 rooms between the source and the sink, and 7 ants.
				3 + 7 = 10.
				Here it takes 10 moves.

				OR

				There are 4 edges(links) and 7 ants.
				Add them together and substract 1.
				4 + 7 - 1 = 10.
				10 moves again.

	Example2:

			ANTS: 12
				source
				|
				room1
				|
				room2
				|
				room3
				|
				room4
				|
				room5
				|
				sink

				There are 5 rooms between the source and the sink, and 12 ants.
				5 + 12 = 17.
				Here it takes 17 moves.

				OR

				There are 6 edges(links) and 12 ants.
				Add them together and substract 1.
				6 + 12 - 1 = 17.
				17 moves again.
